## Overview
Resonance is a request-response based communication framework.
This means that for each request that is being sent, a matching response is expected.
This is done by attaching a unique token to each request and expecting the same token from the response.
Although the request-response pattern is the recommended approach, it is not enforced. Sending messages without expecting any response is possible.

<br/>

The following diagram provides a basic overview of a message being sent.

![alt tag](https://github.com/royben/Resonance/blob/dev/visuals/Resonance_Protocol.png)

<br/>
<br/>

The resonance library might be described by these 3 basic layers:

### Transporting
A transporter responsibility is to provide the API for sending and receiving messages, managing those messages, and propagating the necessary information to other components.

### Transcoding
Encoders and Decoders are components that can be plugged to a transporter, they determine how outgoing/incoming messages should be encoded and whether the data should be encrypted and/or compressed.
The Following built-in transcoding methods are currently supported by the library:
*	Json
*	Bson
*	Protobuf
*	Xml

### Adapters
Adapters can also be plugged to a transporter to determine how outgoing/incoming encoded data is going to be transmitted and where.
The following built-in adapters are currently supported by the library:
*	TCP
*	UDP
*	USB
*	In-Memory
*	SignalR
*	WebRTC
*	Named Pipes
*	Shared Memory

<br/>

The following diagram described a simple request-response scenario.

<br/>

## Getting Started
The first step is deciding about the communication and transcoding methods that we are going to use.
For this demonstration, we are going to use JSON transcoding over TCP/IP as the means of communication between two Transporters.

Here is how we can create the first Transporter with JSON encoding/decoding and TCP/IP adapter.
```c#
        public async void Init()
        {
            IResonanceTransporter transporter = new ResonanceTransporter();

            transporter.Adapter = new TcpAdapter("127.0.0.1", 8888);
            transporter.Encoder = new JsonEncoder();
            transporter.Decoder = new JsonDecoder();

            await transporter.Connect();
        }
```
<br/>

A Transporter can also be instantiated using the fluent syntax builder.
```c#
        public async void Init()
        {
            IResonanceTransporter transporter = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
                .Create()
                .WithTcpAdapter()
                .WithAddress("127.0.0.1")
                .WithPort(8888)
                .WithJsonTranscoding()
                .Build();

            await transporter.Connect();
        }
```
<br/>

Now, since we are using TCP/IP as the means of communication, we need a TCP server/listener to accept incoming connections.<br/>
For that, we are going to use the built-in *ResonanceTcpServer* class.
Although, you can use any other TCP/IP listener.

Here, we are going to create a new TCP server and wait for incoming connections.<br/>
Once a new connection is available, the *ConnectionRequest* event will be triggered.<br/>
The event arguments contains the *Accept* and *Decline* methods for accepting or declining the new connection.<br/>
The accept method returns an initialized *TcpAdapter* that can be used to create the "other side" second Transporter.
```c#
        public async void Init_TcpServer()
        {
            ResonanceTcpServer server = new ResonanceTcpServer(8888);
            server.ConnectionRequest += Server_ConnectionRequest;
            await server.Start();
        }
        
        private async void Server_ConnectionRequest(object sender, ResonanceListeningServerConnectionRequestEventArgs<TcpAdapter> e)
        {
            IResonanceTransporter transporter2 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
                .Create()
                .WithAdapter(e.Accept()) //Call the Accept method to get a new TcpAdapter.
                .WithJsonTranscoding()
                .Build();
                
            await transporter2.Connect();
        }
```
<br/>

Now that we have both transporters connected, we can start sending messages.<br/>
Let's define two simple request and response messages.<Br/>

*CalculateRequest*:
```c#
    public class CalculateRequest
    {
        public double A { get; set; }
        public double B { get; set; }
    }
```
<br/>

*CalculateResponse*:
```c#
    public class CalculateResponse
    {
        public double Sum { get; set; }
    }
```
<br/>

Here is how we can send a *CalculateRequest* from the first Transporter while expecting a *CalculateResponse* from the "other-side" second Transporter.
```c#
    var response = await transporter1.SendRequest<CalculateRequest, CalculateResponse>(new CalculateRequest()
    {
        A = 10,
        B = 5
    });

    Console.WriteLine(response.Sum);
```
<Br/>

Finally, we need to handle the incoming *CalculateRequest* on the second Transporter.<br/>

Handling incoming requests can be achieved using any of the following method:
- Registering a *RequestReceived* event handler.
- Registering a request handler using the *RegisterRequestHandler* method.
- Registering an *IResonanceService* using the *RegisterService* method.

We are going to cover each of the above methods.

<br/>

**Handling incoming requests using the *RequestReceived* event:**
<Br/>

Let's go back to where we accepted the first Transporter connection and initialized the second one.
<Br/>

Here is how we would register for the *RequestReceived* event and respond to the *CalculateRequest* with a *CalculateResponse*.
```c#
    private async void Server_ConnectionRequest(object sender, ResonanceListeningServerConnectionRequestEventArgs<TcpAdapter> e)
    {
        IResonanceTransporter transporter2 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
            .Create()
            .WithAdapter(e.Accept())
            .WithJsonTranscoding()
            .Build();
        
        //Register an event handler..
        transporter2.RequestReceived += Transporter2_RequestReceived;

        await transporter2.Connect();
    }
    
    private async void Transporter2_RequestReceived(object sender, ResonanceRequestReceivedEventArgs e)
    {
        if (e.Request.Message is CalculateRequest calculateRequest)
        {
            if (calculateRequest.A > 0 && calculateRequest.B > 0)
            {
                await e.Transporter.SendResponse(new CalculateResponse()
                {
                    Sum = calculateRequest.A + calculateRequest.B
                }, e.Request.Token);
            }
            else
            {
                await e.Transporter.SendErrorResponse("A & B must be greater than zero", e.Request.Token);
            }
        }
    }
```
<Br/>

Notice, when using this method, we need to explicitly call the Transporter *SendResponse* method while specifying the request token.<br/>
If there are any errors, we can trigger an exception on the other-side Transporter by calling the *SendErrorResponse* method.
<br/>
<br/>

**Handling incoming request using a *Request Handler*:**
<br/>

A better and more intuitive approach is to register a request handler method that will require far less coding, filtering and error handling.

<Br/>

Let's go back again and see how we might register a request handler.

```c#
    private async void Server_ConnectionRequest(object sender, ResonanceListeningServerConnectionRequestEventArgs<TcpAdapter> e)
    {
        IResonanceTransporter transporter2 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
            .Create()
            .WithAdapter(e.Accept())
            .WithJsonTranscoding()
            .Build();
        
        //Register a request handler method...
        transporter2.RegisterRequestHandler<CalculateRequest, CalculateResponse>(HandleCalculateRequest);

        await transporter2.Connect();
    }


    private ResonanceActionResult<CalculateResponse> HandleCalculateRequest(CalculateRequest request)
    {
        if (request.A > 0 && request.B > 0)
        {
            return new CalculateResponse() { Sum = request.A + request.B };
        }
        else
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("A & B must be greater than zero");
        }
    }

```
<Br/>

Notice, when using this method, we don't need to specify the request token,<br/>
and, we are just returning a *CalculateResponse* as the result of the method.
Also, we don't need to explicitly report any errors, we can just throw an exception.
Actually, any exception that occurs while handling a request, will trigger an automatic error response.

<br/>

**Handling incoming requests using a Service:**
<br/>

The last approach for handling incoming requests is to register an instance of *IResonanceService* as a service.<br/>
A Service is basically just a class that contains methods that can handle requests, just like the previous request handler example.
<br/>

Only method that meet the below criteria will be registered as request handlers.
- Accepts only one argument with the request type.
- Returns:
  - void.
  - A generic ResonanceActionResult where T is the type of the response.
  - A generic Task with a generic ResonanceActionResult as the task result.
  
<br/>

Let's create our Calculation Service class.

```c#
    private class CalculationService : IResonanceService
    {
        public ResonanceActionResult<CalculateResponse> Calculate(CalculateRequest request)
        {
            return new CalculateResponse() { Sum = request.A + request.B };
        }

        public void OnTransporterStateChanged(ResonanceComponentState state)
        {
            if (state == ResonanceComponentState.Failed)
            {
                //Connection lost
            }
        }
    }
```
<Br/>

Let's go back again and see how we might register our service.

```c#
    private async void Server_ConnectionRequest(object sender, ResonanceListeningServerConnectionRequestEventArgs<TcpAdapter> e)
    {
        IResonanceTransporter transporter2 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
            .Create()
            .WithAdapter(e.Accept())
            .WithJsonTranscoding()
            .Build();
        
        //Register a service...
        transporter2.RegisterService(new CalculationService());

        await transporter2.Connect();
    }
```
<Br/>

**Congratulations!** we have successfully completed a fully working request-response pattern.

You can continue reading if you want to explore some more advanced topics.

<br/>

## Continuous Response
The continuous response pattern is simply the concept of sending a single request and expecting multiple response messages.<br/>
We are basically opening a constant stream of response messages.<br/>
This pattern is useful if we want to track some state of a remote application.<br/>

In this example, we are going to track a simple made up progress.<br/>
The first Transporter will send a *ProgressRequest* using the *SendContinuousRequest* method.<br/>

Continuous request tracking is made using the Reactive programming style. Meaning, the request sender will need to *Subscribe* and provide *Next*, *Error* and *Completed* callbacks.

First, let's create our *ProgressRequest* and *ProgressResponse* messages.

*ProgressRequest*:
```c#
    public class ProgressRequest
    {
        public int Count { get; set; }
        public TimeSpan Interval { get; set; }
    }
```
<br/>

*ProgressResponse*:
```c#
    public class ProgressResponse
    {
        public int Value { get; set; }
    }
```
<br/>

Now, we are going to initialize two Transporters, send a continuous request from the first one, and respond with multiple response messages from the other.

```c#
        public async void Send_Continuous_Request()
        {
            IResonanceTransporter transporter1 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
               .Create()
               .WithInMemoryAdapter()
               .WithAddress("TEST")
               .WithJsonTranscoding()
               .Build();

            IResonanceTransporter transporter2 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
                .Create()
                .WithInMemoryAdapter()
                .WithAddress("TEST")
                .WithJsonTranscoding()
                .Build();

            await transporter1.Connect();
            await transporter2.Connect();

            transporter2.RegisterRequestHandler<ProgressRequest>(async (t, request) =>
            {
                for (int i = 0; i < request.Message.Count; i++)
                {
                    await t.SendResponse(new ProgressResponse() { Value = i }, request.Token);
                    Thread.Sleep(request.Message.Interval);
                }
            });

            transporter1.SendContinuousRequest<ProgressRequest, ProgressResponse>(new ProgressRequest()
            {
                Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1),
                Count = 10
            }).Subscribe((response) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine(response.Value);
            }, (ex) =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
            }, () =>
            {
                Console.WriteLine($"Continuous Request Completed!");
            });
        }
```

<br/>


## In-Memory Testing
Testing your communication is easier without initializing an actual known communication method. The library implements a special In-Memory Adapter which can be used for testing.<br/>
All you need to do is assign each of the adapters the same address.

```c#
        public async void Demo()
        {
            IResonanceTransporter transporter1 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
                .Create()
                .WithInMemoryAdapter()
                .WithAddress("TEST")
                .WithJsonTranscoding()
                .Build();

            IResonanceTransporter transporter2 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
                .Create()
                .WithInMemoryAdapter()
                .WithAddress("TEST")
                .WithJsonTranscoding()
                .Build();

            await transporter1.Connect();
            await transporter2.Connect();
        }
```

<br/>

## Message Configuration
In all previous example we used the Transporter to send request and response message by providing the request or response objects, but actually, we can specify additional configuration to each request or response message.<br/>

For example, by specifying a request configuration, we can change the default timeout for the request or priority of the message.<br/>

Here is how you would specify the configuration of a simple request message.
```c#
    var response = await transporter1.SendRequest<CalculateRequest, CalculateResponse>(new CalculateRequest()
    {
        A = 10,
        B = 5
    }, new ResonanceRequestConfig()
    {
        //After 5 seconds and no response, a TimeoutException will be thrown.
        Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5),
        
        //This message has high priority in the message queue.
        Priority = Threading.QueuePriority.High,
    });

```
A continuous request configuration also allows specifying the continuous timeout, meaning, the maximum time interval between each message.

<br/>

## Keep Alive
The Resonance library implements an automatic internal keep alive mechanism.<br/>
The keep alive mechanism helps to detect lost connection between adapters.<br/>

We can enable/disable and control a Transporter's keep alive behavior by changing its *KeepAliveConfiguration* property.<br/>

Here is how we would change a Transporter's keep alive configuration.
```c#
     IResonanceTransporter t = new ResonanceTransporter();

     //Enable keep alive.
     t.KeepAliveConfiguration.Enabled = true;

     //Frequency of keep alive messages.
     t.KeepAliveConfiguration.Interval = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5);

     //Maximum failed attempts.
     t.KeepAliveConfiguration.Retries = 4;

     //Respond to the other-side transporter keep alive messages.
     t.KeepAliveConfiguration.EnableAutoResponse = true;

     //Transporter state will change to 'Failed' when keep alive times out.
     t.KeepAliveConfiguration.FailTransporterOnTimeout = true;
```
<br/>

Here is how you can configure the keep alive using the Transporter fluent builder.
```c#
    IResonanceTransporter transporter1 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
        .Create()
        .WithTcpAdapter()
        .WithAddress("127.0.0.1")
        .WithPort(8888)
        .WithJsonTranscoding()
        .WithKeepAlive(interval: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(5), retries: 4)
        .Build();
```
<br/>


## Compression
The Resonance transcoding system provides the ability to compress messages and reduce network bandwidth.<Br/>
Compression and decompression is performed by the Transporter's *Encoder* and *Decoder*.
To enable the encoder compression, you can access the encoder's *CompressionConfiguration*.

```c#
   IResonanceTransporter t = new ResonanceTransporter();
   t.Encoder = new JsonEncoder();
   t.Encoder.CompressionConfiguration.Enabled = true; //Enable compression.
```
<br/>

Or, using the fluent builder...

```c#
   IResonanceTransporter transporter1 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
       .Create()
       .WithInMemoryAdapter()
       .WithAddress("TST")
       .WithJsonTranscoding()
       .NoKeepAlive()
       .NoEncryption()
       .WithCompression() //Enable compression
       .Build();
```
<br/>

Once the Encoder is configured for compression, all sent messages will be compressed.<br/>
There is no need to configure the receiving Decoder as it automatically detects the compression from the message header.<br/>

The library currently uses GZip for fast compression, but you can implement your own compressor by inheriting from *IResonanceCompressor* and assigning an instance to the CompressionConfiguration "Compressor" property.

<br/>

## Encryption
The Resonance transcoding system also provides the ability to encrypt and decrypt outgoing and incoming messages.<br/>
Although some of the adapters already supports their internal encryption like the SignalR and WebRTC adapters, you might want to implement your own.<br/>

The Resonance library implements its own automatic SSL style encryption using a handshake that is initiated in order to exchange encryption information.<br/>
The handshake negotiation is done by the *IHandshakeNegotiator* interface.<br/>

In order to secure a communication channel each participant needs to create an *Asymmetric* RSA private-public key pair, then share the public key with the remote peer along with a random password that is encrypted using the same RSA provider.<br/>
Once the password is acquired by both participants, they can start send and receive messages using a faster *Symmetric* encryption based on shared random password.

# Logging
The Resonance library takes advantage of structured logs and makes it easy to track the full path of each request.
You can easily trace all communication using your favorite logging library by providing an instance of ILoggingFactory.

**Hooking Resonance to Serilog**

```c#
        public void InitLogging()
        {
            var loggerFactory = new LoggerFactory();
            var logger = new LoggerConfiguration()
                .MinimumLevel.Debug()
                .WriteTo.Console()
                .WriteTo.Seq("http://localhost:5341")
                .CreateLogger();

            loggerFactory.AddSerilog(logger);

            ResonanceGlobalSettings.Default.LoggerFactory = loggerFactory;
        }
```
<br/>

**Specifying logging degree per request**

<br/>

```c#
        public async void Demo()
        {
            IResonanceTransporter transporter1 = ResonanceTransporter.Builder
               .Create().WithTcpAdapter()
               .WithAddress("127.0.0.1")
               .WithPort(8888)
               .WithJsonTranscoding()
               .WithKeepAlive()
               .NoEncryption()
               .WithCompression()
               .Build();

            await transporter1.Connect();

            CalculateRequest request = new CalculateRequest() { A = 10, B = 5 };

            //Log request and response names
            var response = await transporter1.SendRequest<CalculateRequest, CalculateResponse>(request,
                new ResonanceRequestConfig() { LoggingMode = ResonanceMessageLoggingMode.Title });

            //Log request and response names and content
            response = await transporter1.SendRequest<CalculateRequest, CalculateResponse>(request,
                new ResonanceRequestConfig() { LoggingMode = ResonanceMessageLoggingMode.Content });
        }
```
